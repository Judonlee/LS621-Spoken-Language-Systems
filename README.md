## Endsem Project: Wavenet TTS

Implement the Wavenet architecture for Text-To-Speech
- Target was to generate speech in French using the *SIWIS French Speech Synthesis Database* as a training source
- Able to show a working model which trains on limited memory and compute using multiprocessing to generate training batches-on the-fly
- Could not produce coherent test samples (generated audio) as the model was not run for sufficient time
